# A Working Document of Working Principles

My constantly-changing, (mostly) Co-opted list, derived from other sources, filtered and described through my own fallible lens of things I aspire to at work.

[ Uncredited sources and inspiration include Creativity Inc. (Ed Catmull), 10 Bullets (Tom Sachs), the Agile Manifesto, ReWork (37 Signals), Hemingway’s Writing Principles, Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation (Tim Brown), Ted Nelson, and many others… ]

1. __Only do quality. Quality is a prerequisite.__
    * No new process is going to make your work excellent, more creative, or give it more impact on the world.
    * "Quality is not a result of process. It is a prerequisite." - Ed Catmull
    * Set the bar as high as possible. No Internal or External force should have the authority to lower that bar.
    * “Syrup on shit doesn’t make it a pancake.” - Aaron James Draplin
2. __Start early.__
    * You will never have all the information, so it is senseless to wait for it. Start with what you have. Make assumptions and adjust as information comes in.
    * "If I Had More Time, I Would Have Written a Shorter Letter,” –the time to create the simple and the focused exists if you start sooner.
3. __Thou shalt not bike-shed.__
    * If there are more opinions in the room than dirty hands, your project will fail.
4. __Own the work.__
    * Everyone in the business should be allowed and encouraged to stop sub-par work from going out the door.
    * Empower people at all levels to have ownership of the work. 
5. __Generate Ideas alone. Workshop them together.__
    * Science shows us that group brainstorming produces fewer high-quality ideas than when people think on their own.
    * HOWEVER, Design thinking exercises & idea writing in groups can be wildly successful.
6. __Be Persistent. Persistence is mandatory.__
    * "Protect new ideas from people who don’t understand that in order for greatness to emerge there has to be a period of non-greatness."
    * "Nothing can take the place of persistence. Talent will not, nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not, unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not, the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. - Ray Kroc
    * See Bullet 9 - Tom Sachs
    * "Every single Pixar film, at one time or another, has been the worst movie ever put on film. But we know. We trust our process. We don't get scared and say, 'Oh, no, this film isn't working.’" - John Lasseter
7. __Foster a culture of candor.__
    * Candor is essential to creativity because it enables the director (or product manager, or entrepreneur, or artist — fill in your title here) to receive direct and constructive feedback that allows her to transform an idea that sucks to one that doesn’t. - Ameet Ranadive
    * “Don’t seek praise, seek criticism.” - Paul Arden
    * Feedback is about the work, not about you as a human being.
    * “It’s the film, not the filmmaker, that is under the microscope.” - One of the core principles for Pixar’s success is the ability to foster creativity through candor. “The Brain Trust"
8. __Cultivate a beginner’s mind.__
    * Cultivate an attitude of Shoshin (Beginner’s Mind), openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions
    * The most ingenious and transformative questions (and solutions) often come from the ‘non-expert’
    * "The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.” -  Arthur C. Clarke
9. __Build projects around motivated individuals. (Agile Manifesto Principle 5)__
    * Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
    * If you are a motivated individual, great projects will be built around you
10. __Fall back on formal processes only when things aren’t working well.__
    * "The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.” - Agile Manifesto
    * "Processes must be flexible and evolve quickly. Keep this in mind and build lightweight systems. Give a good idea to a mediocre team and they will screw it up. Give a mediocre idea to a great team and they will fix it or replace it." - Ed Catmull
11. __Remember that, “Everything is deeply intertwingled…"__
    * “...the cross-connections among the myriad topics of this world simply cannot be divided up neatly.” -Ted Nelson
    * Your area of expertise is deeply connected to and intermingled with areas where you might lack expertise
    * The overlaps between your expertise and another’s is where the magic of collaboration starts
12. __Always Be Knolling.__ - Tom Sachs


Some Rules for meetings:
1. __Have objectives.__ Meetings must have tangible objectives, and either result in assignments for team members or mark the completion of a project (hooray!). Agendas are not objectives. Also, communicate these objectives to participants in advance  so everyone can properly do #2. 
2. __Do your homework.__ If you find yourself in a meeting where you only brought your opinion, you should leave the meeting (unless, of course, the objective of the meeting is to get your opinion).
3. __Finish early.__ Just because a meeting is booked for an hour does not mean that you  should fill said hour with meeting. One of the greatest gifts is giving people their time back. 
4. __Listen more than you speak.__ You might learn something.
5. Question your contribution. If you walk out of a meeting with no assignment, get your assignment, or, question whether you are needed in the next meeting - also question whether you are needed on the project.
6. Do it Now. If it takes nearly the same amount of time to create a ‘todo’ as to do the task, do the task. Edit the deck / script / tech-spec / code / stylesheet / etc. now. __Right. F-ing. Now.__
7. __Pick up your fucking glass.__ At the minimum, pick up after yourself. Leave the room cleaner and more organized (knolling!) than you found it. This makes for a better environment, and demonstrates respect for the people you work with.
